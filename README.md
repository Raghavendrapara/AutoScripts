# Repo for My Selenium Scripts

### ECG_PTB Dataset Download Automation
Since I required to download this dataset from PhysioNet website in .mat format, it was turning out to be very tedious to download from the archives as one has to click one by one on next record and download a single mat file. Doing this for about 538 data signals, I decided to write a script to automate the process using Selenium and chromedriver. It was a great experience learning this and finally achieving the goal.
